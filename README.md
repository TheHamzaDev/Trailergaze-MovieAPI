# Trailergaze
A simple movie API website that allows users to find the currently most popular movies, view their details, including the most recent trailer, an overview, director(s) and the cast. 

Users can also add the movies to their watchlist where it is saved on to their local storage and search for their favourite movie.

This project was made with React.JS, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Context API and the TMDB API.

The website is responsive and can be viewed on both desktop and mobile devices.
